Neural Style Transfer run the Keras library on top of Tensorflow with a VGG19 (or 16) framework to transfer the style of one image onto the content of another.  The program allows the user to manipulate many of the variables, use multiple images as style sources, and mask off certain aspects of the content image either to remain unchanged, or to have a secondary style source applied.  Access to the large number of variables does require user to finetune the parameters over multiple iterations, and the style of abstract art patterns cannot be fully realized without sacrificing content.
