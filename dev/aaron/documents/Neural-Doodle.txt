Neural Doodle was developed by Alex Champandard in the spring of 2016.  It allows the user to take a piece of art and rearange the stylistic elements to synthesize a new work of art.  Users must supply three image files: the original painting providing the artistic style, an semantic map of this painting to guide the neural network in identifying the paintings major elements, and an output semantic map that instructs the program where these elements should appear in the sythesized image.  
It uses the python library Theano to perform the high level calculations required for deeplearning, and the Lasagne library to create a network of convolutional layers for image filtering and processing.  These convolutional layers are combination of VGG19 framework (stopping at layer 4_2) and an auxiliary network for using the semantic layers as reference.
