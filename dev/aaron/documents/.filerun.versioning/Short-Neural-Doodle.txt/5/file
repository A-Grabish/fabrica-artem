Using the Theano and Lasagne libraries, Neural Doodle allows the user to take a piece of art or picture and rearange the stylistic elements to synthesize a new work of art using user made semantic maps to identify the style image's major elements and where these elements should appear in the synthesized image.  These sythesized images look very similar to the original.  The program only works well with pictures or paintings of repeating paterns (leaves on a bush, skin of fruit), not more complicated images (buildings, people).
